This _ B-1

a _ I-1
nice _ I-1
quality _ I-1
lightweight _ I-1
blouse _ I-1
, _ I-1
great _ I-1
for _ I-1
summer _ I-1
weather _ I-1
. _ I-1
It _ I-1
is _ I-1
lightweight _ I-1
, _ I-1
and _ I-1
slightly _ I-1
see _ I-1
through _ I-1
when _ I-1
wearing _ I-1
darker _ I-1
undergarments _ I-1
. _ I-1
It _ I-1
fits _ I-1
loosely _ I-1
so _ I-1
it's _ I-1
flattering _ I-1
on _ I-1
larger _ I-1
body _ I-1
types _ I-1
and _ I-1
it's _ I-1
pretty _ I-1
long _ I-1
so _ I-1
it _ I-1
looks _ I-1
good _ I-1
either _ I-1
tucked _ I-1
in _ I-1
or _ I-1
untucked _ I-1
. _ I-1
The _ I-1
material _ I-1
is _ I-1
soft _ I-1
and _ I-1
flowy _ I-1
and _ I-1
it's _ I-1
comfortable _ I-1
to _ I-1
wear _ I-1
. _ I-1

Fits _ B-1
great _ I-1
, _ I-1
very _ I-1
flowy _ I-1
and _ I-1
comfortable _ I-1
to _ I-1
wear _ I-1
. _ I-1
Just _ I-1
long _ I-1
enough _ I-1
to _ I-1
cover _ I-1
the _ I-1
front _ I-1
pouch _ I-1
. _ I-1

This _ B-1
top _ I-1
is _ I-1
going _ I-1
to _ I-1
be _ I-1
so _ I-1
fun _ I-1
to _ I-1
wear _ I-1
this _ I-1
summer _ I-1
! _ I-1
The _ I-1
print _ I-1
is _ I-1
so _ I-1
pretty _ I-1
and _ I-1
the _ I-1
cut _ I-1
is _ I-1
flattering _ I-1

I _ B-1
loved _ I-1
this _ I-1
bathing _ I-1
suit _ I-1
. _ I-1
Was _ I-1
very _ I-1
comfortable _ I-1
and _ I-1
did _ I-1
what _ I-1
it _ I-1
said _ I-1
for _ I-1
tummy _ I-1
control _ I-1
. _ I-1
Only _ I-1
downside _ I-1
was _ I-1
the _ I-1
butt _ I-1
started _ I-1
to _ I-1
sag _ I-1
once _ I-1
it _ I-1
got _ I-1
wet _ I-1
and _ I-1
never _ I-1
went _ I-1
back _ I-1
to _ I-1
normal _ I-1
. _ I-1

Overall _ B-0
this _ I-0
swimsuit _ I-0
doesn't _ I-0
deserve _ I-0
a _ I-0
1 _ I-0
star _ I-0
, _ I-0
however _ I-0
the _ I-0
sizing _ I-0
is _ I-0
way _ I-0
off _ I-0
. _ I-0
I _ I-0
recently _ I-0
bought _ I-0
a _ I-0
couple _ I-0
of _ I-0
dresses _ I-0
and _ I-0
I _ I-0
ordered _ I-0
the _ I-0
size _ I-0
recommended _ I-0
by _ I-0
Amazon _ I-0
. _ I-0
When _ I-0
the _ I-0
dresses _ I-0
arrived _ I-0
they _ I-0
were _ I-0
too _ I-0
small _ I-0
and _ I-0
I _ I-0
had _ I-0
to _ I-0
send _ I-0
them _ I-0
back _ I-0
and _ I-0
order _ I-0
a _ I-0
larger _ I-0
size _ I-0
. _ I-0

When _ B-0
you _ I-0
first _ I-0
put _ I-0
this _ I-0
on _ I-0
, _ I-0
it _ I-0
is _ I-0
cute _ I-0
and _ I-0
flattering _ I-0
. _ I-0
Unfortunately _ I-0
, _ I-0
after _ I-0
even _ I-0
a _ I-0
single _ I-0
use _ I-0
, _ I-0
it _ I-0
starts _ I-0
to _ I-0
look _ I-0
yellow _ I-0
and _ I-0
the _ I-0
white _ I-0
does _ I-0
not _ I-0
stay _ I-0
white _ I-0
for _ I-0
very _ I-0
long _ I-0
. _ I-0

Bought _ B-0

bathing _ I-0
suit _ I-0

my _ I-0
upcoming _ I-0
vacation _ I-0
. _ I-0
Washed _ I-0
on _ I-0
cold _ I-0
gentle _ I-0
and _ I-0
the _ I-0
fabric _ I-0
faded _ I-0
and _ I-0
became _ I-0
splotchy _ I-0
. _ I-0
Didn _ I-0
’ _ I-0
t _ I-0
even _ I-0
get _ I-0
a _ I-0
chance _ I-0

’ _ I-0
ve _ I-0
ever _ I-0
owned _ I-0
. _ I-0

OMG _ B-0

See _ I-0

GIANT _ I-0
BLOOD _ I-0
STAIN _ I-0

I'm _ I-0
disgusted _ I-0
in _ I-0
fulfillment _ I-0

so _ I-0
much _ I-0
more _ I-0
. _ I-0
I _ I-0
was _ I-0
so _ I-0
excited _ I-0
to _ I-0

Now _ I-0

just _ I-1
right _ I-1
, _ I-1
not _ I-1
super _ I-1
short _ I-1
. _ I-1
And _ I-1
I _ I-1
appreciate _ I-1

as _ I-1
a _ I-1
newish _ I-1
mom _ I-1
with _ I-1
an _ I-1
unfamiliar _ I-1
tummy _ I-1
. _ I-1
They _ I-1
have _ I-1
a _ I-1
little _ I-1
stretch _ I-1
, _ I-1
but _ I-1
also _ I-1
they _ I-1
feel _ I-1
sturdy _ I-1
enough _ I-1
to _ I-1
last _ I-1
a _ I-1
long _ I-1
time _ I-1
. _ I-1
I _ I-1
got _ I-1
the _ I-1

These _ B-0
shorts _ I-0
completely _ I-0
came _ I-0
apart _ I-0
in _ I-0
the _ I-0
leg _ I-0
after _ I-0
washing _ I-0

Now _ I-0
there's _ I-0
a _ I-0
massive _ I-0
slit _ I-0
up _ I-0
the _ I-0
leg _ I-0
and _ I-0
they _ I-0
are _ I-0
unwearable _ I-0
. _ I-0
They _ I-0
should _ I-0
be _ I-0
able _ I-0
to _ I-0
dry _ I-0
on _ I-0
tumble _ I-0

low _ I-0

apparently _ I-0

a _ I-0
LONG _ I-0

I _ I-0

These _ B-1

amazing _ I-1

I _ I-1
have _ I-1
arthritis _ I-1
and _ I-1
my _ I-1
knees _ I-1
were _ I-1
really _ I-1
bothering _ I-1
me _ I-1
and _ I-1
then _ I-1
a _ I-1
friend _ I-1
told _ I-1
me _ I-1
about _ I-1
Brooks _ I-1
shoes _ I-1

how _ I-1
they _ I-1
are _ I-1
the _ I-1

The _ I-1
Brooks _ I-1
Ghost _ I-1

works _ I-1
best _ I-1

I _ B-1
’ _ I-1

by _ I-1

the _ I-1
most _ I-1
comfortable _ I-1

Wore _ I-1
the _ I-1
last _ I-1

for _ I-1
a _ I-1
year _ I-1

out _ I-1
5 _ I-1

these _ I-1

as _ I-1
comfortable _ I-1
as _ I-1
the _ I-1
Ghost _ I-1
14 _ I-1
. _ I-1
These _ I-1
fit _ I-1
like _ I-1
a _ I-1
glove _ I-1
, _ I-1
offer _ I-1
fantastic _ I-1
support _ I-1
and _ I-1
at _ I-1
the _ I-1
end _ I-1
of _ I-1
an _ I-1
8 _ I-1
+ _ I-1
hour _ I-1
day _ I-1
my _ I-1
feet _ I-1
DO _ I-1
NOT _ I-1
HURT _ I-1
! _ I-1
And _ I-1
my _ I-1
knees _ I-1
and _ I-1
back _ I-1
actually _ I-1
hurt _ I-1
less _ I-1
. _ I-1
I _ I-1
think _ I-1
you _ I-1
’ _ I-1
ll _ I-1
agree _ I-1
that _ I-1
for _ I-1
the _ I-1
price _ I-1
you _ I-1
won _ I-1
’ _ I-1
t _ I-1
find _ I-1
a _ I-1
better _ I-1
made _ I-1
, _ I-1
more _ I-1
comfortable _ I-1
shoe _ I-1
. _ I-1

I _ B-1
really _ I-1
like _ I-1
these _ I-1
shoes _ I-1
, _ I-1
they're _ I-1
my _ I-1
first _ I-1
pair _ I-1
of _ I-1
Brooks _ I-1
and _ I-1
was _ I-1
recommended _ I-1
by _ I-1
a _ I-1
friend _ I-1
. _ I-1
The _ I-1
toes _ I-1
are _ I-1
slightly _ I-1
pointed _ I-1
upward _ I-1
so _ I-1
my _ I-1
toes _ I-1
don't _ I-1
rub _ I-1
against _ I-1
the _ I-1
cloth _ I-1
which _ I-1
has _ I-1
been _ I-1
an _ I-1
issue _ I-1
for _ I-1
me _ I-1
with _ I-1
previous _ I-1
shoes _ I-1
. _ I-1
I _ I-1
also _ I-1
have _ I-1
a _ I-1
high _ I-1
arch _ I-1
and _ I-1
these _ I-1
feel _ I-1
really _ I-1
comfortable _ I-1
and _ I-1
almost _ I-1
kind _ I-1
of _ I-1
bounce _ I-1
when _ I-1
I _ I-1
walk _ I-1
. _ I-1
I'm _ I-1
excited _ I-1
for _ I-1
the _ I-1
pain _ I-1
relief _ I-1

No _ B-1
other _ I-1
shoes _ I-1
have _ I-1
ever _ I-1
kept _ I-1
my _ I-1
feet _ I-1
so _ I-1
comfortable _ I-1
on _ I-1
my _ I-1
long _ I-1
shifts _ I-1
at _ I-1
the _ I-1
hospital _ I-1
! _ I-1
! _ I-1
And _ I-1
I _ I-1
always _ I-1
get _ I-1
compliments _ I-1
on _ I-1
the _ I-1
color _ I-1
! _ I-1
Love _ I-1
these _ I-1
shoes _ I-1
and _ I-1
I _ I-1
will _ I-1
never _ I-1
wear _ I-1
any _ I-1
other _ I-1
brand _ I-1
again _ I-1
! _ I-1

I _ B-1
looked _ I-1
all _ I-1
over _ I-1
, _ I-1
online _ I-1
& _ I-1
in _ I-1
stores _ I-1
& _ I-1
tried _ I-1
on _ I-1
a _ I-1
bunch _ I-1
of _ I-1
shoes _ I-1
before _ I-1
getting _ I-1
these _ I-1
. _ I-1
I _ I-1
tried _ I-1
the _ I-1
Ghost _ I-1
15 _ I-1
& _ I-1
latest _ I-1
Adrenaline _ I-1
( _ I-1
? _ I-1
I _ I-1
think _ I-1
) _ I-1
on _ I-1
in _ I-1
a _ I-1
store _ I-1
& _ I-1
the _ I-1
ghost _ I-1
is _ I-1
so _ I-1
much _ I-1
lighter _ I-1
of _ I-1
a _ I-1
shoe _ I-1
. _ I-1
I _ I-1
do _ I-1
dog _ I-1
walking _ I-1
& _ I-1
the _ I-1
shoes _ I-1
I _ I-1
have _ I-1
don't _ I-1
have _ I-1
support _ I-1
& _ I-1
I _ I-1
was _ I-1
having _ I-1
achilles _ I-1
heel _ I-1
pain _ I-1
. _ I-1
I _ I-1
saw _ I-1
a _ I-1
neighbor _ I-1
wearing _ I-1
the _ I-1
same _ I-1
shoes _ I-1
& _ I-1
asked _ I-1
her _ I-1
about _ I-1
them _ I-1
& _ I-1
she _ I-1
said _ I-1
she _ I-1
likes _ I-1
them _ I-1
so _ I-1
much _ I-1
she _ I-1
won't _ I-1
go _ I-1
back _ I-1
to _ I-1
the _ I-1
previous _ I-1
brand _ I-1
she _ I-1
had _ I-1
been _ I-1
wearing _ I-1
for _ I-1
years _ I-1
. _ I-1
These _ I-1
are _ I-1
comfortable _ I-1
, _ I-1
lightweight _ I-1
, _ I-1
breathable _ I-1
& _ I-1
have _ I-1
a _ I-1
huge _ I-1
selection _ I-1
of _ I-1
colors _ I-1
too _ I-1
. _ I-1
They _ I-1
are _ I-1
really _ I-1
good _ I-1
shoes _ I-1
with _ I-1
support _ I-1
! _ I-1
! _ I-1
I _ I-1
haven't _ I-1
had _ I-1
any _ I-1
heel _ I-1
pain _ I-1
since _ I-1
the _ I-1
first _ I-1
couple _ I-1
of _ I-1
days _ I-1
. _ I-1
Thumbs _ I-1
way _ I-1
up _ I-1
! _ I-1
! _ I-1

I _ B-0
had _ I-0
heard _ I-0
how _ I-0
comfortable _ I-0
Brooks _ I-0
shoes _ I-0
were _ I-0
, _ I-0
but _ I-0
these _ I-0
cause _ I-0
me _ I-0
a _ I-0
ton _ I-0
of _ I-0
foot _ I-0
pain _ I-0
. _ I-0
I _ I-0
’ _ I-0
ve _ I-0
given _ I-0
them _ I-0
time _ I-0
to _ I-0
be _ I-0
broken _ I-0
in _ I-0
( _ I-0
about _ I-0
10 _ I-0
miles _ I-0
worth _ I-0
) _ I-0
, _ I-0
but _ I-0
they _ I-0
hurt _ I-0
me _ I-0
more _ I-0
than _ I-0
any _ I-0
other _ I-0
athletic _ I-0
shoe _ I-0
I _ I-0
’ _ I-0
ve _ I-0
ever _ I-0
worn _ I-0
. _ I-0
I _ I-0
wish _ I-0
I _ I-0
could _ I-0
return _ I-0
them _ I-0
, _ I-0
but _ I-0
I _ I-0
’ _ I-0
ve _ I-0
worn _ I-0
them _ I-0
and _ I-0
that _ I-0
’ _ I-0
s _ I-0
not _ I-0
right _ I-0
. _ I-0
If _ I-0
you _ I-0
have _ I-0
a _ I-0
brand _ I-0
that _ I-0
works _ I-0
for _ I-0
you _ I-0
, _ I-0
don _ I-0
’ _ I-0
t _ I-0
be _ I-0
swayed _ I-0
by _ I-0
others _ I-0
’ _ I-0
opinion _ I-0
. _ I-0

I _ B-0
have _ I-0
purchased _ I-0
and _ I-0
worn _ I-0
multiple _ I-0
Ghost _ I-0
13 _ I-0
shoes _ I-0
. _ I-0
I _ I-0
love _ I-0
them _ I-0
, _ I-0
but _ I-0
it _ I-0
looks _ I-0
like _ I-0
they _ I-0
are _ I-0
going _ I-0
out _ I-0
and _ I-0
are _ I-0
difficult _ I-0
to _ I-0
find _ I-0
. _ I-0
I _ I-0
decided _ I-0
to _ I-0
take _ I-0
a _ I-0
chance _ I-0
and _ I-0
try _ I-0
a _ I-0
pair _ I-0
of _ I-0
the _ I-0
14s _ I-0
. _ I-0
I _ I-0
have _ I-0
tried _ I-0
to _ I-0
love _ I-0
the _ I-0
14 _ I-0
’ _ I-0
s _ I-0
. _ I-0
I _ I-0
am _ I-0
a _ I-0
healthcare _ I-0
professional _ I-0
and _ I-0
these _ I-0
shoes _ I-0
are _ I-0
very _ I-0
painful _ I-0
. _ I-0
The _ I-0
shoe _ I-0
laces _ I-0
do _ I-0
not _ I-0
stay _ I-0
tied _ I-0
on _ I-0
these _ I-0
either _ I-0
, _ I-0
which _ I-0
is _ I-0
very _ I-0
annoying _ I-0
. _ I-0
I _ I-0
never _ I-0
once _ I-0
had _ I-0
that _ I-0
problem _ I-0
with _ I-0
the _ I-0
13s _ I-0
that _ I-0
I _ I-0
have _ I-0
worn _ I-0
for _ I-0
years _ I-0
and _ I-0
purchased _ I-0
many _ I-0
. _ I-0
Hate _ I-0
is _ I-0
a _ I-0
strong _ I-0
word _ I-0
, _ I-0
but _ I-0
I _ I-0
really _ I-0
hate _ I-0
these _ I-0
Ghost _ I-0
14s _ I-0
. _ I-0
I _ I-0
cannot _ I-0
get _ I-0
through _ I-0
an _ I-0
entire _ I-0
shift _ I-0
without _ I-0
wanting _ I-0
to _ I-0
rip _ I-0
them _ I-0
off _ I-0
of _ I-0
my _ I-0
feet _ I-0
and _ I-0
throw _ I-0
them _ I-0
across _ I-0
the _ I-0
room _ I-0
! _ I-0

I _ B-0
am _ I-0
right _ I-0
hand _ I-0
dominant _ I-0
, _ I-0
so _ I-0
my _ I-0
right _ I-0
food _ I-0
should _ I-0
be _ I-0
slightly _ I-0
bigger _ I-0
then _ I-0
my _ I-0
left _ I-0
foot _ I-0
; _ I-0
ergo _ I-0
the _ I-0
left _ I-0
shoe _ I-0
should _ I-0
fit _ I-0
slightly _ I-0
looser _ I-0
. _ I-0
However _ I-0
, _ I-0
the _ I-0
left _ I-0
shoe _ I-0
feels _ I-0
as _ I-0
though _ I-0
it _ I-0
is _ I-0
not _ I-0
size _ I-0
7 _ I-0
- _ I-0
wide _ I-0
. _ I-0
It _ I-0
fits _ I-0
tighter _ I-0
than _ I-0
the _ I-0
right _ I-0
shoe _ I-0
. _ I-0
Also _ I-0
, _ I-0
the _ I-0
left _ I-0
shoe _ I-0
is _ I-0
actually _ I-0
painful _ I-0
in _ I-0
the _ I-0
arch _ I-0
after _ I-0
wearing _ I-0
them _ I-0
for _ I-0
less _ I-0
then _ I-0
5 _ I-0
minutes _ I-0
. _ I-0
I _ I-0
rarely _ I-0
return _ I-0
anything _ I-0
I _ I-0
buy _ I-0
, _ I-0
but _ I-0
these _ I-0
shoes _ I-0
must _ I-0
be _ I-0
returned _ I-0
. _ I-0

I _ B-0
am _ I-0
sooooo _ I-0
disappointed _ I-0
in _ I-0
the _ I-0
Ghost _ I-0
14 _ I-0
. _ I-0
I _ I-0
had _ I-0
the _ I-0
13s _ I-0
and _ I-0
they _ I-0
were _ I-0
the _ I-0
best _ I-0
shoes _ I-0
ever _ I-0
. _ I-0
I _ I-0
wore _ I-0
the _ I-0
13s _ I-0
until _ I-0
the _ I-0
fabric _ I-0
had _ I-0
holes _ I-0
. _ I-0
I _ I-0
am _ I-0
a _ I-0
massage _ I-0
therapist _ I-0
and _ I-0
average _ I-0
6 _ I-0
massages _ I-0
a _ I-0
day _ I-0
, _ I-0
with _ I-0
a _ I-0
daily _ I-0
30 _ I-0
minute _ I-0
power _ I-0
walk _ I-0
, _ I-0
so _ I-0
good _ I-0
shoes _ I-0
are _ I-0
imperative _ I-0
. _ I-0
I _ I-0
have _ I-0
had _ I-0
the _ I-0
14s _ I-0
for _ I-0
3 _ I-0
months _ I-0
and _ I-0
now _ I-0
have _ I-0
a _ I-0
terrible _ I-0
ingrown _ I-0
toenail _ I-0
, _ I-0
a _ I-0
very _ I-0
embarrassing _ I-0
corn _ I-0
( _ I-0
which _ I-0
I _ I-0
have _ I-0
never _ I-0
experienced _ I-0
before _ I-0
and _ I-0
I'm _ I-0
only _ I-0
36 _ I-0
) _ I-0
and _ I-0
what _ I-0
I _ I-0
expect _ I-0
to _ I-0
be _ I-0
the _ I-0
start _ I-0
of _ I-0
plantar _ I-0
fasciitis _ I-0
. _ I-0
At _ I-0
this _ I-0
point _ I-0
it _ I-0
is _ I-0
too _ I-0
late _ I-0
to _ I-0
return _ I-0
the _ I-0
shoes _ I-0
, _ I-0
which _ I-0
I _ I-0
payed _ I-0
$110 _ I-0
for _ I-0
. _ I-0
I _ I-0
suspect _ I-0
a _ I-0
large _ I-0
portion _ I-0
of _ I-0
the _ I-0
issue _ I-0
is _ I-0
that _ I-0
they _ I-0
feel _ I-0
cheaper _ I-0
made _ I-0
than _ I-0
the _ I-0
last _ I-0
and _ I-0
definitely _ I-0
have _ I-0
a _ I-0
more _ I-0
narrow _ I-0
fit _ I-0
. _ I-0
So _ I-0
sad _ I-0
. _ I-0

I _ B-0
have _ I-0
been _ I-0
an _ I-0
avid _ I-0
wearer _ I-0
of _ I-0
Brooks _ I-0
for _ I-0
the _ I-0
past _ I-0
several _ I-0
years _ I-0
. _ I-0
I _ I-0
trained _ I-0
for _ I-0
the _ I-0
NYC _ I-0
marathon _ I-0
in _ I-0
this _ I-0
same _ I-0
model _ I-0
of _ I-0
Ghost _ I-0
14 _ I-0
, _ I-0
however _ I-0
, _ I-0
when _ I-0
I _ I-0
purchased _ I-0
a _ I-0
new _ I-0
pair _ I-0
, _ I-0
these _ I-0
do _ I-0
not _ I-0
have _ I-0
the _ I-0
same _ I-0
support _ I-0
, _ I-0
cushion _ I-0
, _ I-0
or _ I-0
running _ I-0
feel _ I-0
. _ I-0
I'm _ I-0
concerned _ I-0
these _ I-0
are _ I-0
a _ I-0
fake _ I-0
pair _ I-0
and _ I-0
am _ I-0
very _ I-0
dissapointed _ I-0
with _ I-0
my _ I-0
experience _ I-0
. _ I-0
They _ I-0
are _ I-0
a _ I-0
completely _ I-0
different _ I-0
shoe _ I-0
. _ I-0

I _ B-0
work _ I-0
in _ I-0
retail _ I-0
and _ I-0
I'm _ I-0
On _ I-0
My _ I-0
Feet _ I-0
8 _ I-0
to _ I-0
10 _ I-0
hours _ I-0
without _ I-0
a _ I-0
break _ I-0
. _ I-0
A _ I-0
co-worker's _ I-0
brother _ I-0
recommended _ I-0
these _ I-0
shoes _ I-0
. _ I-0
I _ I-0
literally _ I-0
took _ I-0
them _ I-0
out _ I-0
of _ I-0
the _ I-0
box _ I-0
put _ I-0
them _ I-0
on _ I-0
stood _ I-0
up _ I-0
and _ I-0
then _ I-0
sit _ I-0
back _ I-0
down _ I-0
and _ I-0
put _ I-0
them _ I-0
back _ I-0
in _ I-0
the _ I-0
box _ I-0
. _ I-0
There's _ I-0
absolutely _ I-0
no _ I-0
Cushing _ I-0
! _ I-0

These _ B-1
shorts _ I-1
are _ I-1
absolutely _ I-1
perfect _ I-1
. _ I-1
I _ I-1
have _ I-1
bought _ I-1
one _ I-1
similar _ I-1
to _ I-1
these _ I-1
on _ I-1
Amazon _ I-1
. _ I-1
However _ I-1
, _ I-1
these _ I-1
are _ I-1
a _ I-1
better _ I-1
fit _ I-1
to _ I-1
my _ I-1
body _ I-1
. _ I-1
I _ I-1
like _ I-1
how _ I-1
the _ I-1
waist _ I-1
band _ I-1
is _ I-1
thicker _ I-1
and _ I-1
higher _ I-1
rise _ I-1
. _ I-1
It _ I-1
does _ I-1
go _ I-1
above _ I-1
my _ I-1
belly _ I-1
button _ I-1
which _ I-1
I _ I-1
love _ I-1
. _ I-1
They _ I-1
do _ I-1
not _ I-1
rise _ I-1
up _ I-1
/ _ I-1
fall _ I-1
down _ I-1
during _ I-1
my _ I-1
workouts _ I-1
either _ I-1
. _ I-1
Will _ I-1
be _ I-1
purchasing _ I-1
more _ I-1
of _ I-1
these _ I-1
. _ I-1

Bought _ B-1
in _ I-1
a _ I-1
large _ I-1
, _ I-1
regular _ I-1
pant _ I-1
size _ I-1
8 _ I-1
/ _ I-1
10 _ I-1
, _ I-1
they _ I-1
fit _ I-1
perfect _ I-1
. _ I-1
I _ I-1
have _ I-1
very _ I-1
wide _ I-1
hips _ I-1
, _ I-1
a _ I-1
big _ I-1
butt _ I-1
, _ I-1
and _ I-1
am _ I-1
1 _ I-1
month _ I-1
postpartum _ I-1
and _ I-1
I _ I-1
bought _ I-1
2 _ I-1
pairs _ I-1
of _ I-1
these _ I-1
to _ I-1
wear _ I-1
while _ I-1
i'm _ I-1
getting _ I-1
back _ I-1
into _ I-1
shape _ I-1
. _ I-1
I _ I-1
usually _ I-1
HATE _ I-1
lined _ I-1
shorts _ I-1
, _ I-1
but _ I-1
these _ I-1
are _ I-1
very _ I-1
comfortable _ I-1
. _ I-1
They're _ I-1
soft _ I-1
, _ I-1
very _ I-1
lightweight _ I-1
and _ I-1
very _ I-1
flattering _ I-1
. _ I-1
Slightly _ I-1
longer _ I-1
in _ I-1
the _ I-1
back _ I-1
which _ I-1
I _ I-1
like _ I-1
. _ I-1
The _ I-1
waistband _ I-1
is _ I-1
the _ I-1
perfect _ I-1
amount _ I-1
of _ I-1
width _ I-1
and _ I-1
stretch _ I-1
to _ I-1
suck _ I-1
in _ I-1
a _ I-1
belly _ I-1
. _ I-1
I _ I-1
love _ I-1
these _ I-1
shorts _ I-1
and _ I-1
i'll _ I-1
probably _ I-1
buy _ I-1
the _ I-1
hot _ I-1
pink _ I-1
color _ I-1
next _ I-1
. _ I-1
Already _ I-1
purchased _ I-1
black _ I-1
and _ I-1
summer _ I-1
red _ I-1

These _ B-1
are _ I-1
my _ I-1
new _ I-1

pants _ I-1
to _ I-1
wear _ I-1
to _ I-1
work _ I-1
and _ I-1
around _ I-1
the _ I-1
house _ I-1
. _ I-1
They _ I-1
fit _ I-1
very _ I-1
well _ I-1
! _ I-1

shorts _ I-1
! _ I-1
Will _ I-1
buy _ I-1
multiple _ I-1
pairs _ I-1
of _ I-1
these _ I-1
because _ I-1
they _ I-1
are _ I-1
so _ I-1
light _ I-1
, _ I-1
comfy _ I-1
and _ I-1
flattering _ I-1
! _ I-1
I _ I-1

something _ I-1

plus _ I-1
and _ I-1
fits _ I-1
my _ I-1
big _ I-1

These _ B-1
short _ I-1
were _ I-1
perfect _ I-1
for _ I-1
vacation _ I-1
for _ I-1
me _ I-1
. _ I-1
Light _ I-1
breathable _ I-1
, _ I-1
had _ I-1
the _ I-1
underwear _ I-1
cover _ I-1
inside _ I-1
which _ I-1
was _ I-1
nice _ I-1
. _ I-1
They _ I-1
were _ I-1
comfortable _ I-1
and _ I-1
mid _ I-1
rise _ I-1
so _ I-1
it _ I-1
didn _ I-1
’ _ I-1
t _ I-1
hit _ I-1
weird _ I-1
on _ I-1
my _ I-1
hips _ I-1

I _ B-0
wanted _ I-0
to _ I-0
love _ I-0
these _ I-0
, _ I-0
and _ I-0
they _ I-0
were _ I-0
comfortable _ I-0
except _ I-0
the _ I-0
waistband _ I-0
kept _ I-0
bunching _ I-0
. _ I-0
The _ I-0
problem _ I-0
was _ I-0
with _ I-0
the _ I-0
material _ I-0
inside _ I-0
the _ I-0
actual _ I-0
waistband _ I-0
- _ I-0
no _ I-0
matter _ I-0
what _ I-0
I _ I-0
did _ I-0
, _ I-0
the _ I-0
material _ I-0
inside _ I-0
kept _ I-0
folding _ I-0
over _ I-0
and _ I-0
would _ I-0
not _ I-0
sit _ I-0
flat _ I-0
against _ I-0
my _ I-0
skin _ I-0
. _ I-0
I _ I-0
would _ I-0
describe _ I-0
it _ I-0
similarly _ I-0
to _ I-0
the _ I-0
removable _ I-0
padding _ I-0
of _ I-0
a _ I-0
bathing _ I-0
suit _ I-0
top _ I-0
moving _ I-0
around _ I-0
and _ I-0
folding _ I-0
and _ I-0
having _ I-0
it _ I-0
take _ I-0
forever _ I-0
to _ I-0
get _ I-0
it _ I-0
back _ I-0
in _ I-0
the _ I-0
right _ I-0
place _ I-0
. _ I-0
Except _ I-0
with _ I-0
these _ I-0
shorts _ I-0
, _ I-0
whenever _ I-0
I _ I-0
moved _ I-0
it _ I-0
just _ I-0
got _ I-0
worse _ I-0
and _ I-0
could _ I-0
not _ I-0
be _ I-0
fixed _ I-0
. _ I-0

the _ B-0
sizes _ I-0

the _ I-0
fact _ I-0
that _ I-0
there _ I-0

pairs _ I-0

size _ I-0

One _ I-0

little _ I-0
tight _ I-0

other _ I-0
a _ I-0
little _ I-0
big _ I-0
! _ I-0
Ended _ I-0
up _ I-0

So _ I-0
bummed _ I-0

These _ B-0
shorts _ I-0
are _ I-0
cute _ I-0
but _ I-0
very _ I-0
cheaply _ I-0
made _ I-0
. _ I-0
The _ I-0
first _ I-0
time _ I-0
I _ I-0
wore _ I-0
them _ I-0
they _ I-0
got _ I-0
caught _ I-0
on _ I-0
a _ I-0
drawer _ I-0
handle _ I-0
and _ I-0
the _ I-0
seam _ I-0
totally _ I-0
ripped _ I-0
making _ I-0
them _ I-0
no _ I-0
longer _ I-0
wearable _ I-0
. _ I-0
I _ I-0
’ _ I-0
m _ I-0
very _ I-0
disappointed _ I-0
because _ I-0
I _ I-0
was _ I-0
excited _ I-0
about _ I-0
them _ I-0
. _ I-0

The _ B-0
zippered _ I-0
pocket _ I-0
broke _ I-0
after _ I-0
a _ I-0
few _ I-0
months _ I-0
of _ I-0
infrequent _ I-0
wear _ I-0
. _ I-0
Big _ I-0
bummer _ I-0
, _ I-0
since _ I-0
that _ I-0
’ _ I-0
s _ I-0
what _ I-0
I _ I-0
got _ I-0
them _ I-0
for _ I-0
( _ I-0
the _ I-0
zippered _ I-0
pocket _ I-0
) _ I-0
. _ I-0
The _ I-0
top _ I-0
of _ I-0
the _ I-0
pocket _ I-0
came _ I-0
lose _ I-0
at _ I-0
the _ I-0
end _ I-0
after _ I-0
use _ I-0
and _ I-0
then _ I-0
the _ I-0
zipper _ I-0
zipped _ I-0
right _ I-0
off _ I-0
and _ I-0
became _ I-0
lost _ I-0
. _ I-0
Cheap _ I-0
quality _ I-0
. _ I-0
Would _ I-0
not _ I-0
buy _ I-0
this _ I-0
product _ I-0
again _ I-0
. _ I-0

I _ B-0
don't _ I-0
normally _ I-0
write _ I-0
reviews _ I-0
but _ I-0
this _ I-0
needs _ I-0
addressing _ I-0
. _ I-0
I _ I-0
bought _ I-0
this _ I-0
suit _ I-0
last _ I-0
year _ I-0
. _ I-0
It _ I-0
has _ I-0
been _ I-0
worn _ I-0
maybe _ I-0
3 _ I-0
times _ I-0
and _ I-0
has _ I-0
been _ I-0
properly _ I-0
cared _ I-0
for _ I-0
. _ I-0
Right _ I-0
from _ I-0
the _ I-0
first _ I-0
time _ I-0
I _ I-0
worn _ I-0
it _ I-0
I _ I-0
noticed _ I-0
that _ I-0
the _ I-0
elastic _ I-0
around _ I-0
the _ I-0
legs _ I-0
does _ I-0
not _ I-0
hold _ I-0
the _ I-0
suit _ I-0
snuggly _ I-0
and _ I-0
leaves _ I-0
me _ I-0
kind _ I-0
of _ I-0
flapping _ I-0
in _ I-0
the _ I-0
wind _ I-0
, _ I-0
especially _ I-0
when _ I-0
it _ I-0
is _ I-0
wet _ I-0
. _ I-0
I _ I-0
originally _ I-0
thought _ I-0
that _ I-0
I _ I-0
was _ I-0
imagining _ I-0
it _ I-0
but _ I-0
I _ I-0
wore _ I-0
it _ I-0
this _ I-0
past _ I-0
weekend _ I-0
and _ I-0
was _ I-0
very _ I-0
uncomfortable _ I-0
and _ I-0
did _ I-0
not _ I-0
wear _ I-0
it _ I-0
again _ I-0
. _ I-0
I _ I-0
am _ I-0
very _ I-0
disappointed _ I-0
and _ I-0
now _ I-0
it _ I-0
is _ I-0
too _ I-0
late _ I-0
to _ I-0
return _ I-0
it _ I-0
. _ I-0

I _ B-0
was _ I-0
very _ I-0
excited _ I-0
to _ I-0
try _ I-0
this _ I-0
suit _ I-0
but _ I-0
is _ I-0
barely _ I-0
covers _ I-0
my _ I-0
bust _ I-0
( _ I-0
38DD _ I-0
) _ I-0
and _ I-0
absolutely _ I-0
no _ I-0
support _ I-0
for _ I-0
them _ I-0
. _ I-0
I _ I-0
am _ I-0
trying _ I-0
to _ I-0
get _ I-0
away _ I-0
from _ I-0
underwire _ I-0
two _ I-0
piece _ I-0
suits _ I-0
and _ I-0
this _ I-0
one _ I-0
looked _ I-0
quite _ I-0
cute _ I-0
but _ I-0
I _ I-0
was _ I-0
very _ I-0
disappointed _ I-0
with _ I-0
the _ I-0
fit _ I-0
