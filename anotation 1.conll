In _ B-0
general _ I-0
I _ I-0
was _ I-0
not _ I-0
satisfied _ I-0
, _ I-0
vitamin _ I-0
c _ I-0
irritates _ I-0
my _ I-0
skin _ I-0
which _ I-0
is _ I-0
very _ I-0
itchy _ I-0
, _ I-0
the _ I-0
other _ I-0
two _ I-0
products _ I-0
when _ I-0
I _ I-0
apply _ I-0
it _ I-0
and _ I-0
then _ I-0
apply _ I-0
moisturizer _ I-0
or _ I-0
sunscreen _ I-0
peels _ I-0
off _ I-0
the _ I-0
skin _ I-0
leaving _ I-0
a _ I-0
bad _ I-0
aspect _ I-0
that _ I-0
is _ I-0
difficult _ I-0
to _ I-0
remove _ I-0
. _ I-0

I _ B-0
really _ I-0
don't _ I-0
like _ I-0
this _ I-0
product _ I-0
the _ I-0
vitamin _ I-0
c _ I-0
is _ I-0
water _ I-0
and _ I-0
gritty _ I-0
and _ I-0
the _ I-0
other _ I-0
two _ I-0
leaves _ I-0
my _ I-0
face _ I-0
white _ I-0

i _ B-0
don _ I-0
’ _ I-0
t _ I-0
like _ I-0

anything _ I-0

my _ I-0

not _ I-0
buy _ I-0
again _ I-0

I _ B-0
had _ I-0
a _ I-0
bad _ I-0
experience _ I-0
with _ I-0
this _ I-0
product _ I-0
. _ I-0
My _ I-0
skin _ I-0
couldn't _ I-0
bear _ I-0
this _ I-0
formula _ I-0
, _ I-0
now _ I-0
I'm _ I-0
having _ I-0
severe _ I-0
acne _ I-0
on _ I-0
entire _ I-0
face _ I-0
. _ I-0

It _ B-0
dries _ I-0
out _ I-0
my _ I-0
face _ I-0
, _ I-0
feels _ I-0
poor _ I-0
quality _ I-0

Just _ B-0
terrible _ I-0
. _ I-0
It _ I-0
’ _ I-0
s _ I-0
not _ I-0
hydrating _ I-0
in _ I-0
anyway _ I-0
, _ I-0
the _ I-0
SPF _ I-0
is _ I-0
chalky _ I-0
, _ I-0
nothing _ I-0
goes _ I-0
on _ I-0
smoothly _ I-0
. _ I-0
I _ I-0
cannot _ I-0
believe _ I-0
this _ I-0
product _ I-0
has _ I-0
so _ I-0
many _ I-0
good _ I-0
reviews _ I-0
. _ I-0
I _ I-0
missed _ I-0
my _ I-0
return _ I-0
window _ I-0
by _ I-0
one _ I-0
day _ I-0
and _ I-0
I _ I-0
’ _ I-0
m _ I-0
so _ I-0
upset _ I-0
. _ I-0

Product _ B-0
expired _ I-0
! _ I-0
! _ I-0
! _ I-0
! _ I-0
! _ I-0
! _ I-0
Do _ I-0
not _ I-0
buy _ I-0

This _ B-0
was _ I-0
the _ I-0
only _ I-0
addition _ I-0
to _ I-0
my _ I-0
routine _ I-0
and _ I-0
it _ I-0
BURNED _ I-0
and _ I-0
I _ I-0
tried _ I-0
to _ I-0
wash _ I-0
it _ I-0
off _ I-0
but _ I-0
not _ I-0
fast _ I-0
enough _ I-0
cuz _ I-0
everything _ I-0
blistered _ I-0
and _ I-0
it _ I-0
was _ I-0
so _ I-0
so _ I-0
bad _ I-0
. _ I-0
I _ I-0
cried _ I-0
. _ I-0
I _ I-0
couldnt _ I-0
sleep _ I-0
. _ I-0
This _ I-0
was _ I-0
2 _ I-0
days _ I-0
ago _ I-0
and _ I-0
even _ I-0
now _ I-0
my _ I-0
skin _ I-0
is _ I-0
DRY _ I-0
like _ I-0
so _ I-0
so _ I-0
dry _ I-0
. _ I-0
It _ I-0
still _ I-0
burns _ I-0
. _ I-0
Its _ I-0
shiny _ I-0
with _ I-0
dryness _ I-0
and _ I-0
texture _ I-0
. _ I-0
I _ I-0
am _ I-0
miserable _ I-0

Products _ B-0
were _ I-0
expired _ I-0
. _ I-0
Vitamin _ I-0
c _ I-0
had _ I-0
solid _ I-0
chunks _ I-0
in _ I-0
it _ I-0
, _ I-0
rubbed _ I-0
off _ I-0
in _ I-0
flakes _ I-0
off _ I-0
my _ I-0
face _ I-0
. _ I-0
Do _ I-0
not _ I-0
buy _ I-0

I _ B-0
was _ I-0
so _ I-0
disappointed _ I-0
because _ I-0
this _ I-0
stuff _ I-0
came _ I-0
highly _ I-0
recommended _ I-0
. _ I-0
The _ I-0
stuff _ I-0
stinks _ I-0
so _ I-0
badly _ I-0
. _ I-0
It's _ I-0
either _ I-0
really _ I-0
oily _ I-0
or _ I-0
super _ I-0
drying _ I-0
and _ I-0
plays _ I-0
tug _ I-0
of _ I-0
war _ I-0
with _ I-0
my _ I-0
skin _ I-0
. _ I-0
Didn't _ I-0
work _ I-0
for _ I-0
me _ I-0
because _ I-0
my _ I-0
skin _ I-0
kept _ I-0
breaking _ I-0
out _ I-0
and _ I-0
looking _ I-0
terrible _ I-0
. _ I-0
Would _ I-0
not _ I-0
recommend _ I-0
and _ I-0
will _ I-0
never _ I-0
buy _ I-0
again _ I-0
. _ I-0

I _ B-0
bought _ I-0
these _ I-0
without _ I-0
any _ I-0
expectations _ I-0
and _ I-0
I _ I-0
’ _ I-0
m _ I-0
usually _ I-0
okay _ I-0
with _ I-0
products _ I-0
that _ I-0
make _ I-0
my _ I-0
face _ I-0
tingle _ I-0
. _ I-0
But _ I-0
these _ I-0
just _ I-0
burned _ I-0
so _ I-0
much _ I-0
! _ I-0
I _ I-0
don _ I-0
’ _ I-0
t _ I-0
have _ I-0
sensitive _ I-0
skin _ I-0
and _ I-0
I _ I-0
think _ I-0
I _ I-0
can _ I-0
handle _ I-0
most _ I-0
products _ I-0
but _ I-0
the _ I-0
burning _ I-0
on _ I-0
these _ I-0
is _ I-0
just _ I-0
too _ I-0
much _ I-0
! _ I-0
Made _ I-0
me _ I-0
think _ I-0
that _ I-0
there _ I-0
was _ I-0
something _ I-0
wrong _ I-0
with _ I-0
the _ I-0
product _ I-0
and _ I-0
I _ I-0
returned _ I-0
it _ I-0
. _ I-0
Never _ I-0
again _ I-0
. _ I-0

So _ B-0
I _ I-0
may _ I-0
have _ I-0
gotten _ I-0
a _ I-0
bad _ I-0
batch _ I-0
, _ I-0
but _ I-0
my _ I-0
Vitamin _ I-0
C _ I-0
suspension _ I-0
was _ I-0
like _ I-0
rubbing _ I-0
sandpaper _ I-0
on _ I-0
my _ I-0
face _ I-0
, _ I-0
which _ I-0
doesn _ I-0
’ _ I-0
t _ I-0
help _ I-0
the _ I-0
burn _ I-0
. _ I-0
It _ I-0
’ _ I-0
s _ I-0
horrible _ I-0
. _ I-0

I _ B-0
got _ I-0
this _ I-0
because _ I-0
I _ I-0
heard _ I-0
good _ I-0
things _ I-0
about _ I-0
it _ I-0
. _ I-0
I _ I-0
was _ I-0
hoping _ I-0
that _ I-0
this _ I-0
would _ I-0
help _ I-0
keep _ I-0
my _ I-0
face _ I-0
moisturized _ I-0
after _ I-0
using _ I-0
facial _ I-0
scrub _ I-0
. _ I-0
And _ I-0
it _ I-0
worked _ I-0
for _ I-0
a _ I-0
good _ I-0
two _ I-0
weeks _ I-0
. _ I-0
But _ I-0
I _ I-0
soon _ I-0
started _ I-0
to _ I-0
notice _ I-0
red _ I-0
, _ I-0
dry _ I-0
flaky _ I-0
areas _ I-0
around _ I-0
my _ I-0
eyes _ I-0
and _ I-0
a _ I-0
couple _ I-0
spots _ I-0
on _ I-0
my _ I-0
face _ I-0
. _ I-0
I _ I-0
didn _ I-0
’ _ I-0
t _ I-0
think _ I-0
anything _ I-0
of _ I-0
it _ I-0
at _ I-0
first _ I-0
so _ I-0
I _ I-0
kept _ I-0
using _ I-0
the _ I-0
moisturizing _ I-0
cream _ I-0
and _ I-0
was _ I-0
applying _ I-0
directly _ I-0
to _ I-0
the _ I-0
areas _ I-0
that _ I-0
were _ I-0
dry _ I-0
. _ I-0
I _ I-0
soon _ I-0
realized _ I-0
that _ I-0
it _ I-0
was _ I-0
the _ I-0
cream _ I-0
itself _ I-0
making _ I-0
my _ I-0
face _ I-0
break _ I-0
out _ I-0
in _ I-0
dry _ I-0
spots _ I-0
. _ I-0
I _ I-0
’ _ I-0
m _ I-0
not _ I-0
sure _ I-0
if _ I-0
I _ I-0
’ _ I-0
m _ I-0
allergic _ I-0
to _ I-0
it _ I-0
or _ I-0
just _ I-0
have _ I-0
sensitive _ I-0
skin _ I-0
, _ I-0
also _ I-0
combined _ I-0
with _ I-0
the _ I-0
fact _ I-0
that _ I-0
I _ I-0
used _ I-0
to _ I-0
have _ I-0
eczema _ I-0
. _ I-0
Would _ I-0
say _ I-0
that _ I-0
if _ I-0
you _ I-0
want _ I-0
to _ I-0
try _ I-0
this _ I-0
cream _ I-0
out _ I-0
, _ I-0
apply _ I-0
it _ I-0
to _ I-0
only _ I-0
a _ I-0
small _ I-0
area _ I-0
to _ I-0
start _ I-0
to _ I-0
see _ I-0
if _ I-0
you _ I-0
have _ I-0
similar _ I-0
effects _ I-0
. _ I-0
But _ I-0
yeah _ I-0
, _ I-0
won _ I-0
’ _ I-0
t _ I-0
be _ I-0
buying _ I-0
again _ I-0
lmao _ I-0
. _ I-0

I've _ B-0
used _ I-0
other _ I-0
cerave _ I-0
lotions _ I-0
with _ I-0
almost _ I-0
the _ I-0
same _ I-0
ingredients _ I-0
list _ I-0
and _ I-0
never _ I-0
had _ I-0
an _ I-0
issue _ I-0
. _ I-0
Put _ I-0
it _ I-0
on _ I-0
and _ I-0
it _ I-0
immediately _ I-0
started _ I-0
burning _ I-0
. _ I-0
I _ I-0
chalked _ I-0
it _ I-0
up _ I-0
to _ I-0
putting _ I-0
it _ I-0
on _ I-0
after _ I-0
my _ I-0
weekly _ I-0
routine _ I-0
. _ I-0
Tried _ I-0
putting _ I-0
it _ I-0
on _ I-0
again _ I-0
after _ I-0
my _ I-0
shower _ I-0
that _ I-0
night _ I-0
, _ I-0
and _ I-0
the _ I-0
burning _ I-0
was _ I-0
so _ I-0
horrible _ I-0
I _ I-0
had _ I-0
to _ I-0
wash _ I-0
it _ I-0
off _ I-0
. _ I-0
Two _ I-0
days _ I-0
later _ I-0
and _ I-0
my _ I-0
skin _ I-0
is _ I-0
still _ I-0
sensitive _ I-0
and _ I-0
peeling _ I-0
from _ I-0
it _ I-0
. _ I-0
No _ I-0
other _ I-0
changes _ I-0
in _ I-0
my _ I-0
skincare _ I-0
besides _ I-0
this _ I-0
lotion _ I-0
. _ I-0
Not _ I-0
sure _ I-0
if _ I-0
it's _ I-0
even _ I-0
cerave _ I-0
because _ I-0
I've _ I-0
never _ I-0
had _ I-0
this _ I-0
issue _ I-0
. _ I-0
Tried _ I-0
it _ I-0
on _ I-0
my _ I-0
feet _ I-0
and _ I-0
it's _ I-0
fine _ I-0
. _ I-0
Just _ I-0
messed _ I-0
up _ I-0
my _ I-0
face _ I-0
. _ I-0
Wouldn't _ I-0
really _ I-0
recommend _ I-0
it _ I-0
, _ I-0
I've _ I-0
had _ I-0
better _ I-0
body _ I-0
lotions _ I-0
. _ I-0
Definitely _ I-0
check _ I-0
before _ I-0
putting _ I-0
on _ I-0
your _ I-0
face _ I-0
though _ I-0

I'm _ B-0
really _ I-0
not _ I-0
sure _ I-0
how _ I-0
this _ I-0
product _ I-0
has _ I-0
so _ I-0
many _ I-0
positive _ I-0
reviews _ I-0
. _ I-0
. _ I-0
. _ I-0
it's _ I-0
terrible _ I-0
. _ I-0
It _ I-0
may _ I-0
actually _ I-0
be _ I-0
a _ I-0
knock-off _ I-0
like _ I-0
some _ I-0
of _ I-0
the _ I-0
other _ I-0
1 _ I-0
- _ I-0
star _ I-0
reviews _ I-0
said _ I-0
, _ I-0
because _ I-0
I _ I-0
have _ I-0
heard _ I-0
good _ I-0
things _ I-0
about _ I-0
the _ I-0
product _ I-0
from _ I-0
other _ I-0
black _ I-0
women _ I-0
IRL _ I-0
. _ I-0

I _ B-0
used _ I-0
this _ I-0
with _ I-0
my _ I-0
whole _ I-0
last _ I-0
pregnancy _ I-0
three _ I-0
years _ I-0
ago _ I-0
and _ I-0
I _ I-0
was _ I-0
so _ I-0
very _ I-0
disappointed _ I-0
at _ I-0
the _ I-0
strong _ I-0
odor _ I-0
of _ I-0
men's _ I-0
cologne _ I-0
/ _ I-0
strong _ I-0
dial _ I-0
bar _ I-0
soap _ I-0
? _ I-0
It _ I-0
stinks _ I-0
. _ I-0
And _ I-0
it _ I-0
doesn't _ I-0
fade _ I-0
quickly _ I-0
. _ I-0
The _ I-0
product _ I-0
might _ I-0
still _ I-0
work _ I-0
good _ I-0
but _ I-0
I _ I-0
dont _ I-0
think _ I-0
I _ I-0
can _ I-0
stomach _ I-0
the _ I-0
smell _ I-0
every _ I-0
day _ I-0
plus _ I-0
I _ I-0
doubt _ I-0
my _ I-0
husband _ I-0
wants _ I-0
me _ I-0
to _ I-0
smell _ I-0
like _ I-0
an _ I-0
old _ I-0
man _ I-0
. _ I-0
. _ I-0
. _ I-0
this _ I-0
seller _ I-0
should _ I-0
be _ I-0
reported _ I-0
because _ I-0
it _ I-0
seems _ I-0
like _ I-0
some _ I-0
people _ I-0
get _ I-0
a _ I-0
good _ I-0
product _ I-0
and _ I-0
some _ I-0
people _ I-0
get _ I-0
the _ I-0
other _ I-0
. _ I-0
I'm _ I-0
going _ I-0
to _ I-0
try _ I-0
buying _ I-0
a _ I-0
bottle _ I-0
at _ I-0
walmart _ I-0

I _ B-0
bought _ I-0
a _ I-0
large _ I-0
bottle _ I-0
fully _ I-0
intending _ I-0
to _ I-0
use _ I-0
it _ I-0
regularly _ I-0
, _ I-0
which _ I-0
will _ I-0
also _ I-0
help _ I-0
to _ I-0
prevent _ I-0
loosening _ I-0
teeth _ I-0
. _ I-0
I _ I-0
used _ I-0
it _ I-0
every _ I-0
morning _ I-0
and _ I-0
night _ I-0
for _ I-0
about _ I-0
2 _ I-0
weeks _ I-0
but _ I-0
it _ I-0
burns _ I-0
my _ I-0
mouth _ I-0
almost _ I-0
intolerably _ I-0
making _ I-0
it _ I-0
hard _ I-0
to _ I-0
swish _ I-0
it _ I-0
for _ I-0
more _ I-0
than _ I-0
5 _ I-0
seconds _ I-0
that's _ I-0
why _ I-0
I _ I-0
mixed _ I-0
it _ I-0
with _ I-0
some _ I-0
water _ I-0
. _ I-0
The _ I-0
first _ I-0
couple _ I-0
days _ I-0
of _ I-0
using _ I-0
the _ I-0
product _ I-0
I _ I-0
got _ I-0
some _ I-0
sloughing _ I-0
. _ I-0
I _ I-0
figured _ I-0
it _ I-0
was _ I-0
my _ I-0
gums _ I-0
getting _ I-0
adjusted _ I-0
to _ I-0
the _ I-0
new _ I-0
mouth _ I-0
wash _ I-0
. _ I-0
But _ I-0
after _ I-0
two _ I-0
weeks _ I-0
of _ I-0
using _ I-0
this _ I-0
product _ I-0
, _ I-0
I _ I-0
get _ I-0
severe _ I-0
sloughing _ I-0
everyday _ I-0
. _ I-0
My _ I-0
gums _ I-0
are _ I-0
now _ I-0
extra _ I-0
sensitive _ I-0
and _ I-0
irritated _ I-0
. _ I-0
And _ I-0
it _ I-0
also _ I-0
leave _ I-0
a _ I-0
blue _ I-0
stain _ I-0
in _ I-0
my _ I-0
tounge _ I-0
which _ I-0
is _ I-0
so _ I-0
hard _ I-0
to _ I-0
get _ I-0
rid _ I-0
of _ I-0
. _ I-0
I _ I-0
plan _ I-0
to _ I-0
return _ I-0
it _ I-0
but _ I-0
it _ I-0
was _ I-0
too _ I-0
late _ I-0
because _ I-0
my _ I-0
husband _ I-0
already _ I-0
poured _ I-0
it _ I-0
down _ I-0
the _ I-0
drain _ I-0
. _ I-0
It _ I-0
is _ I-0
absolutely _ I-0
waste _ I-0
of _ I-0
my _ I-0
money _ I-0
. _ I-0

There _ B-0
was _ I-0
no _ I-0
seal _ I-0
. _ I-0
The _ I-0
cap _ I-0
easily _ I-0
opened _ I-0
. _ I-0
Unfortunately _ I-0
, _ I-0
I _ I-0
had _ I-0
to _ I-0
throw _ I-0
it _ I-0
out _ I-0
because _ I-0
of _ I-0
the _ I-0
safety _ I-0
concern _ I-0
. _ I-0
I _ I-0
do _ I-0
not _ I-0
know _ I-0
who _ I-0
tampered _ I-0
with _ I-0
the _ I-0
product _ I-0
and _ I-0
my _ I-0
family _ I-0
and _ I-0
I _ I-0
would _ I-0
be _ I-0
pouring _ I-0
this _ I-0
liquid _ I-0
into _ I-0
our _ I-0
mouths _ I-0
. _ I-0
It _ I-0
wouldn _ I-0
’ _ I-0
t _ I-0
even _ I-0
be _ I-0
worth _ I-0
the _ I-0
time _ I-0
, _ I-0
energy _ I-0
and _ I-0
gas _ I-0
money _ I-0
to _ I-0
return _ I-0
this _ I-0
. _ I-0
What _ I-0
a _ I-0
waste _ I-0
/ _ I-0
scam _ I-0
. _ I-0

I _ B-0
typically _ I-0
use _ I-0
the _ I-0
blue _ I-0
Listerene _ I-0
but _ I-0
decided _ I-0
to _ I-0
try _ I-0
this _ I-0
flavor _ I-0
. _ I-0
That _ I-0
was _ I-0
a _ I-0
mistake _ I-0
. _ I-0
This _ I-0
one _ I-0
( _ I-0
Freshburst _ I-0
) _ I-0
tastes _ I-0
horrible _ I-0
! _ I-0
It _ I-0
has _ I-0
an _ I-0
after _ I-0
taste _ I-0
of _ I-0
like _ I-0
ashes _ I-0
or _ I-0
burnt _ I-0
cigarette _ I-0
butts _ I-0
or _ I-0
something _ I-0
like _ I-0
that _ I-0
. _ I-0
Let _ I-0
me _ I-0
put _ I-0
out _ I-0
there _ I-0
that _ I-0
I _ I-0
do _ I-0
not _ I-0
smoke _ I-0
. _ I-0
I _ I-0
tried _ I-0
it _ I-0
3 _ I-0
different _ I-0
days _ I-0
just _ I-0
to _ I-0
make _ I-0
sure _ I-0
I _ I-0
wasn't _ I-0
crazy _ I-0
. _ I-0
. _ I-0
. _ I-0
. _ I-0
and _ I-0
all _ I-0
three _ I-0
times _ I-0
it _ I-0
had _ I-0
the _ I-0
same _ I-0
horrible _ I-0
taste _ I-0
. _ I-0
I _ I-0
DO _ I-0
NOT _ I-0
recommend _ I-0
. _ I-0

Very _ B-0
disappointed _ I-0
. _ I-0
All _ I-0
the _ I-0
razor _ I-0
were _ I-0
dull _ I-0
. _ I-0
I _ I-0
totally _ I-0
wasted _ I-0
my _ I-0
money _ I-0
. _ I-0
I _ I-0
will _ I-0
never _ I-0
purchase _ I-0
these _ I-0
razor _ I-0
ever _ I-0
again _ I-0
. _ I-0
I _ I-0
would _ I-0
not _ I-0
recommend _ I-0
these _ I-0
razors _ I-0
to _ I-0
anyone _ I-0
. _ I-0

I _ B-0
didn _ I-0
’ _ I-0
t _ I-0
like _ I-0
the _ I-0
way _ I-0
these _ I-0
razors _ I-0
made _ I-0
my _ I-0
skin _ I-0
feel _ I-0
after _ I-0
I _ I-0
shaved _ I-0
. _ I-0
My _ I-0
legs _ I-0
felt _ I-0
like _ I-0
I _ I-0
had _ I-0
many _ I-0
micro _ I-0
cuts _ I-0
and _ I-0
they _ I-0
were _ I-0
irritated _ I-0
after _ I-0
. _ I-0
I _ I-0
’ _ I-0
ll _ I-0
try _ I-0
another _ I-0
brand _ I-0
and _ I-0
won _ I-0
’ _ I-0
t _ I-0
try _ I-0
these _ I-0
again _ I-0
. _ I-0

Based _ B-0
on _ I-0
reviews _ I-0
I _ I-0
decided _ I-0
to _ I-0
try _ I-0
this _ I-0
moisturizer _ I-0
as _ I-0
my _ I-0
usual _ I-0
type _ I-0
is _ I-0
getting _ I-0
more _ I-0
difficult _ I-0
to _ I-0
find _ I-0
. _ I-0
My _ I-0
skin _ I-0
is _ I-0
not _ I-0
sensitive _ I-0
and _ I-0
I _ I-0
have _ I-0
not _ I-0
had _ I-0
any _ I-0
issues _ I-0
with _ I-0
other _ I-0
lotions _ I-0
or _ I-0
creams _ I-0
in _ I-0
the _ I-0
past _ I-0
. _ I-0
My _ I-0
first _ I-0
disappointment _ I-0
when _ I-0
opening _ I-0
the _ I-0
product _ I-0
was _ I-0
how _ I-0
little _ I-0
there _ I-0
was _ I-0
in _ I-0
the _ I-0
jar _ I-0
. _ I-0
I _ I-0
washed _ I-0
my _ I-0
face _ I-0
as _ I-0
usual _ I-0
and _ I-0
then _ I-0
went _ I-0
to _ I-0
apply _ I-0
. _ I-0
The _ I-0
consistency _ I-0
is _ I-0
very _ I-0
weird _ I-0
, _ I-0
but _ I-0
I _ I-0
expected _ I-0
that _ I-0
since _ I-0
it _ I-0
was _ I-0
described _ I-0
as _ I-0
a _ I-0
gel _ I-0
. _ I-0
Within _ I-0
seconds _ I-0
of _ I-0
applying _ I-0
to _ I-0
my _ I-0
face _ I-0
, _ I-0
my _ I-0
skin _ I-0
began _ I-0
burning _ I-0
. _ I-0
I _ I-0
had _ I-0
to _ I-0
immediately _ I-0
remove _ I-0
and _ I-0
apply _ I-0
my _ I-0
normal _ I-0
moisturizer _ I-0
. _ I-0

I _ B-0
was _ I-0
so _ I-0
excited _ I-0
to _ I-0
try _ I-0
this _ I-0
product _ I-0
. _ I-0
I _ I-0
received _ I-0
it _ I-0
on _ I-0
1 _ I-0
/ _ I-0
19 _ I-0
/ _ I-0
23 _ I-0
. _ I-0
Today _ I-0
is _ I-0
1 _ I-0
/ _ I-0
30 _ I-0
/ _ I-0
23 _ I-0
. _ I-0
I've _ I-0
tried _ I-0
it _ I-0
a _ I-0
few _ I-0
times _ I-0
and _ I-0
it _ I-0
made _ I-0
my _ I-0
skin _ I-0
super _ I-0
dry _ I-0
, _ I-0
skin _ I-0
pealing _ I-0
, _ I-0
and _ I-0
burns _ I-0
really _ I-0
bad _ I-0
. _ I-0
The _ I-0
only _ I-0
thing _ I-0
about _ I-0
this _ I-0
product _ I-0
that _ I-0
I _ I-0
liked _ I-0
was _ I-0
that _ I-0
it _ I-0
is _ I-0
unscented _ I-0
. _ I-0
I _ I-0
had _ I-0
to _ I-0
stop _ I-0
using _ I-0
it _ I-0
because _ I-0
it _ I-0
is _ I-0
painful _ I-0
! _ I-0
I'll _ I-0
go _ I-0
back _ I-0
to _ I-0
the _ I-0
other _ I-0
stuff _ I-0
that _ I-0
I _ I-0
use _ I-0
. _ I-0
. _ I-0
. _ I-0

I _ B-0
feel _ I-0
awful _ I-0
this _ I-0
didn't _ I-0
work _ I-0
for _ I-0
me _ I-0
. _ I-0
I _ I-0
had _ I-0
such _ I-0
hopes _ I-0
. _ I-0
I _ I-0
have _ I-0
sensitive _ I-0
skin _ I-0
/ _ I-0
body _ I-0
. _ I-0
I _ I-0
can't _ I-0
use _ I-0
many _ I-0
products _ I-0
. _ I-0
But _ I-0
this _ I-0
I _ I-0
gave _ I-0
a _ I-0
chance _ I-0
due _ I-0
to _ I-0
reviews _ I-0
by _ I-0
folks _ I-0
with _ I-0
sensitive _ I-0
skin _ I-0
. _ I-0
Nope _ I-0
. _ I-0
My _ I-0
face _ I-0
swelled _ I-0
up _ I-0
. _ I-0
I'm _ I-0
glad _ I-0
it _ I-0
works _ I-0
for _ I-0
many _ I-0
folks _ I-0
, _ I-0
but _ I-0
if _ I-0
you _ I-0
are _ I-0
REALLY _ I-0
supersensitive _ I-0
, _ I-0
take _ I-0
this _ I-0
as _ I-0
a _ I-0
warning _ I-0
. _ I-0

Not _ B-0
the _ I-0
same _ I-0
that _ I-0
I've _ I-0
bought _ I-0
at _ I-0
stores _ I-0
. _ I-0
Didn't _ I-0
have _ I-0
any _ I-0
kind _ I-0
of _ I-0
seal _ I-0
on _ I-0
it _ I-0
at _ I-0
all _ I-0
so _ I-0
the _ I-0
cream _ I-0
was _ I-0
all _ I-0
over _ I-0
cap _ I-0
and _ I-0
it _ I-0
had _ I-0
a _ I-0
scent _ I-0
also _ I-0
. _ I-0
Returned _ I-0
it _ I-0

This _ B-0
product _ I-0
doesn't _ I-0
hydrate _ I-0
anything _ I-0
. _ I-0
It _ I-0
feels _ I-0
good _ I-0
when _ I-0
you _ I-0
first _ I-0
put _ I-0
it _ I-0
on _ I-0
, _ I-0
but _ I-0
after _ I-0
a _ I-0
little _ I-0
while _ I-0
, _ I-0
your _ I-0
skin _ I-0
absorbs _ I-0
it _ I-0
and _ I-0
goes _ I-0
back _ I-0
to _ I-0
being _ I-0
even _ I-0
dryer _ I-0
. _ I-0
Doesn't _ I-0
work _ I-0
at _ I-0
all _ I-0

I _ B-1
have _ I-1
never _ I-1
received _ I-1
so _ I-1
many _ I-1
compliments _ I-1
on _ I-1
my _ I-1
skin _ I-1
! _ I-1
I _ I-1
always _ I-1
feel _ I-1
like _ I-1
I _ I-1
have _ I-1
that _ I-1
freshly _ I-1
moisturized _ I-1
dewy _ I-1
skin _ I-1
! _ I-1
I _ I-1
have _ I-1
always _ I-1
worn _ I-1
full _ I-1
foundation _ I-1
to _ I-1
cover _ I-1
uneven _ I-1
, _ I-1
dark _ I-1
, _ I-1
or _ I-1
dry _ I-1
spots _ I-1
. _ I-1
Now _ I-1
I _ I-1
barely _ I-1
wear _ I-1
anything _ I-1
at _ I-1
all _ I-1
! _ I-1
At _ I-1
47 _ I-1
this _ I-1
makes _ I-1
me _ I-1
very _ I-1
happy _ I-1
! _ I-1

I _ B-1
love _ I-1
this _ I-1
moisturizer _ I-1
so _ I-1
much _ I-1
! _ I-1
It _ I-1
’ _ I-1
s _ I-1
lightweight _ I-1
but _ I-1
provides _ I-1
just _ I-1
the _ I-1
right _ I-1
anoint _ I-1
of _ I-1
hydration _ I-1
to _ I-1
my _ I-1
skin _ I-1
. _ I-1
I _ I-1
use _ I-1
it _ I-1
morning _ I-1
and _ I-1
night _ I-1
, _ I-1
a _ I-1
little _ I-1
goes _ I-1
a _ I-1
long _ I-1
way _ I-1
! _ I-1
This _ I-1
is _ I-1
a _ I-1
staple _ I-1
to _ I-1
my _ I-1

this _ I-1
will _ I-1
now _ I-1
be _ I-1
staying _ I-1
in _ I-1
my _ I-1
routine _ I-1
. _ I-1
It _ I-1
makes _ I-1
my _ I-1
skin _ I-1
feel _ I-1
not _ I-1

immediately _ I-1
moisturized _ I-1
but _ I-1
it _ I-1
stays _ I-1

Hi _ B-1
have _ I-1
had _ I-1
the _ I-1
wonderful _ I-1
pleasure _ I-1
of _ I-1
adult _ I-1
acne _ I-1
for _ I-1
the _ I-1
last _ I-1
6 _ I-1
years _ I-1
. _ I-1
Fun _ I-1
, _ I-1
I _ I-1
know _ I-1
. _ I-1
I _ I-1
found _ I-1
this _ I-1
while _ I-1
trying _ I-1
to _ I-1
learn _ I-1
more _ I-1
about _ I-1
retinol _ I-1
and _ I-1
this _ I-1
is _ I-1
now _ I-1
a _ I-1
holy _ I-1
grail _ I-1
. _ I-1
It _ I-1
took _ I-1
a _ I-1
few _ I-1
times _ I-1
for _ I-1
my _ I-1
skin _ I-1
to _ I-1
get _ I-1
used _ I-1
to _ I-1
it _ I-1
. _ I-1

I _ B-1
love _ I-1
all _ I-1
The _ I-1
Ordinary _ I-1
products _ I-1
. _ I-1
Right _ I-1
now _ I-1
I _ I-1
’ _ I-1
m _ I-1
using _ I-1
all _ I-1
the _ I-1
products _ I-1
for _ I-1
my _ I-1
skincare _ I-1
routing _ I-1
. _ I-1
I _ I-1
think _ I-1
the _ I-1
serum _ I-1
has _ I-1
definitely _ I-1
improved _ I-1
my _ I-1
skin _ I-1
appearance _ I-1
. _ I-1
It _ I-1
doesn _ I-1
’ _ I-1
t _ I-1
have _ I-1
any _ I-1
scent _ I-1

I've _ B-1
never _ I-1
used _ I-1
products _ I-1
by _ I-1
the _ I-1
company _ I-1
. _ I-1
I _ I-1
was _ I-1
very _ I-1
skeptical _ I-1
at _ I-1
first _ I-1
especially _ I-1
with _ I-1
the _ I-1
price _ I-1
. _ I-1
I _ I-1
was _ I-1
amazed _ I-1
. _ I-1
I _ I-1
will _ I-1
definitely _ I-1
put _ I-1
hade _ I-1
again _ I-1

I _ B-1
tried _ I-1
5 _ I-1
different _ I-1
flossers _ I-1
, _ I-1
and _ I-1
these _ I-1
are _ I-1
still _ I-1
my _ I-1
favourite _ I-1
. _ I-1
Floss _ I-1
never _ I-1
breaks _ I-1
, _ I-1
plastic _ I-1
is _ I-1
easy _ I-1
to _ I-1
hold _ I-1
and _ I-1
control _ I-1
. _ I-1
It _ I-1
feels _ I-1
good _ I-1
on _ I-1
the _ I-1
teeth _ I-1
. _ I-1
If _ I-1
there _ I-1
is _ I-1
a _ I-1
flavour _ I-1
, _ I-1
I _ I-1
can't _ I-1
really _ I-1
tell _ I-1
( _ I-1
which _ I-1
I _ I-1
like _ I-1
) _ I-1
. _ I-1
Dentist _ I-1
said _ I-1
that _ I-1
normal _ I-1
String-Form _ I-1
floss _ I-1
is _ I-1
better _ I-1
because _ I-1
it _ I-1
hugs _ I-1
the _ I-1
tooth _ I-1
, _ I-1
but _ I-1
that _ I-1
these _ I-1
kinds _ I-1
are _ I-1
better _ I-1
than _ I-1
not _ I-1
flossing.These _ I-1
make _ I-1
it _ I-1
enjoyable _ I-1
. _ I-1

I _ B-1
’ _ I-1
ve _ I-1
tried _ I-1
a _ I-1
lot _ I-1
of _ I-1
different _ I-1
floss _ I-1
picks _ I-1
, _ I-1
and _ I-1
these _ I-1
are _ I-1
unequivocally _ I-1
the _ I-1
best _ I-1
. _ I-1
The _ I-1
ones _ I-1
you _ I-1
get _ I-1
at _ I-1
CVS _ I-1
or _ I-1
Walgreens _ I-1
are _ I-1
cheap _ I-1
and _ I-1
fall _ I-1
apart _ I-1
easily _ I-1
, _ I-1
these _ I-1
are _ I-1
the _ I-1
only _ I-1
ones _ I-1
I _ I-1
can _ I-1
consistently _ I-1
use _ I-1
to _ I-1
actually _ I-1
floss _ I-1
my _ I-1
entire _ I-1
mouth _ I-1
. _ I-1
I _ I-1
’ _ I-1
ve _ I-1
been _ I-1
using _ I-1
them _ I-1
for _ I-1
years _ I-1
without _ I-1
incident _ I-1
or _ I-1
disappointment _ I-1
. _ I-1
This _ I-1
product _ I-1
is _ I-1
unequivocally _ I-1
better _ I-1
than _ I-1
anything _ I-1
else _ I-1
on _ I-1
the _ I-1
market _ I-1

My _ B-1
son _ I-1
has _ I-1
trouble _ I-1
using _ I-1
traditional _ I-1

no _ I-1
issue _ I-1
with _ I-1
these _ I-1
whatsoever _ I-1
, _ I-1
except _ I-1
between _ I-1
the _ I-1
teeth _ I-1
that _ I-1
need _ I-1
adjusting _ I-1
( _ I-1
he _ I-1
still _ I-1
needs _ I-1
braces _ I-1
) _ I-1
- _ I-1
it _ I-1
just _ I-1
takes _ I-1
a _ I-1
little _ I-1
longer _ I-1
for _ I-1
him _ I-1
to _ I-1
floss _ I-1
between _ I-1
those _ I-1
teeth _ I-1
, _ I-1
but _ I-1
he _ I-1
can _ I-1
still _ I-1
get _ I-1
between _ I-1
those _ I-1
teeth _ I-1
, _ I-1
which _ I-1
is _ I-1
what _ I-1
is _ I-1
important _ I-1
. _ I-1
I _ I-1
don _ I-1
’ _ I-1
t _ I-1
have _ I-1
to _ I-1
nag _ I-1
him _ I-1
to _ I-1
floss _ I-1
with _ I-1
these _ I-1
like _ I-1
I _ I-1
did _ I-1
with _ I-1
the _ I-1
floss _ I-1
string _ I-1
, _ I-1
so _ I-1
that _ I-1
’ _ I-1
s _ I-1
a _ I-1
win _ I-1
for _ I-1
me _ I-1

A _ I-1

going _ I-1

my _ I-1
skin _ I-1
off _ I-1

I _ I-1
even _ I-1
dreaded _ I-1
taking _ I-1
showers _ I-1

bad _ I-1

14 _ I-1

37 _ I-1

who _ I-1
was _ I-1
removing _ I-1
it _ I-1
with _ I-1
special _ I-1
tools _ I-1
, _ I-1
nothing _ I-1
helped _ I-1
, _ I-1
it _ I-1
always _ I-1

it _ I-1
3 _ I-1

my _ I-1
skin _ I-1
completely _ I-1

wish _ I-1

after _ I-1
pictures _ I-1
to _ I-1
show _ I-1
the _ I-1
results _ I-1
, _ I-1

i _ I-1
just _ I-1
didn't _ I-1
believe _ I-1
it _ I-1

help _ I-1
, _ I-1
boy _ I-1

i _ I-1
wrong _ I-1

UPDATE _ I-1
: _ I-1
I've _ I-1
been _ I-1
using _ I-1
this _ I-1
for _ I-1
a _ I-1
month _ I-1
now _ I-1
, _ I-1
at _ I-1
least _ I-1
once _ I-1
a _ I-1
day _ I-1
, _ I-1
usually _ I-1
before _ I-1
bed _ I-1
and _ I-1
leaving _ I-1
it _ I-1
on _ I-1
for _ I-1
the _ I-1
night.I _ I-1
cannot _ I-1
believe _ I-1
the _ I-1
difference _ I-1
in _ I-1
my _ I-1
skin _ I-1
! _ I-1
It's _ I-1
the _ I-1
best _ I-1
product _ I-1
I've _ I-1
used _ I-1
. _ I-1
I'm _ I-1
48 _ I-1
and _ I-1
I _ I-1
noticed _ I-1
how _ I-1
large _ I-1
my _ I-1
pores _ I-1
were _ I-1
and _ I-1
was _ I-1
constantly _ I-1
breaking _ I-1
out _ I-1
. _ I-1
Using _ I-1
everything _ I-1
I _ I-1
had _ I-1
tried _ I-1
for _ I-1
years _ I-1
was _ I-1
no _ I-1
longer _ I-1
working _ I-1
on _ I-1
my _ I-1
aging _ I-1
skin _ I-1
was _ I-1
just _ I-1
not _ I-1
cutting _ I-1
it _ I-1
anymore _ I-1
. _ I-1
I _ I-1
had _ I-1
to _ I-1
face _ I-1
the _ I-1
music _ I-1
that _ I-1
aging _ I-1
was _ I-1
happening _ I-1
and _ I-1
I _ I-1
had _ I-1
to _ I-1
step _ I-1
outa _ I-1
my _ I-1
comfort _ I-1
zone _ I-1
and _ I-1
try _ I-1
to _ I-1
find _ I-1
better _ I-1
options _ I-1
. _ I-1
It _ I-1
was _ I-1
VERY _ I-1
difficult _ I-1
to _ I-1
find _ I-1
something _ I-1
that _ I-1
actually _ I-1
worked _ I-1
and _ I-1
worked _ I-1
fast _ I-1
! _ I-1
I'm _ I-1
the _ I-1
type _ I-1
that _ I-1
will _ I-1
give _ I-1
up _ I-1
pretty _ I-1
quickly _ I-1
if _ I-1
I _ I-1
didn't _ I-1
see _ I-1
results _ I-1
in _ I-1
a _ I-1
week _ I-1
or _ I-1
two _ I-1
. _ I-1
Absolutely _ I-1
love _ I-1
this _ I-1
! _ I-1
! _ I-1
! _ I-1

I _ B-1
have _ I-1
used _ I-1
this _ I-1
for _ I-1
quite _ I-1
a _ I-1
while _ I-1
now _ I-1
and _ I-1
I _ I-1
love _ I-1
how _ I-1
smooth _ I-1
my _ I-1
face _ I-1
is _ I-1
. _ I-1
I _ I-1
have _ I-1
sensitive _ I-1
skin _ I-1
and _ I-1
have _ I-1
not _ I-1
had _ I-1
an _ I-1
issue _ I-1
. _ I-1
In _ I-1
the _ I-1
beginning _ I-1
, _ I-1
if _ I-1
you _ I-1
have _ I-1
not _ I-1
tried _ I-1
, _ I-1
use _ I-1
it _ I-1
every _ I-1
other _ I-1
day _ I-1
because _ I-1
it _ I-1
can _ I-1
dry _ I-1
your _ I-1
skin _ I-1
, _ I-1
once _ I-1
acclimated _ I-1
use _ I-1
daily _ I-1
. _ I-1
The _ I-1
only _ I-1
downside _ I-1
is _ I-1
that _ I-1
it _ I-1
does _ I-1
not _ I-1
smell _ I-1
all _ I-1
that _ I-1
great _ I-1
and _ I-1
if _ I-1
you _ I-1
get _ I-1
it _ I-1
on _ I-1
your _ I-1
lips _ I-1
and _ I-1
happen _ I-1
to _ I-1
lick _ I-1
them _ I-1
, _ I-1
it _ I-1
has _ I-1
a _ I-1
nasty _ I-1
taste _ I-1
. _ I-1
But _ I-1
I _ I-1
love _ I-1
the _ I-1
product _ I-1
so _ I-1
it _ I-1
is _ I-1
what _ I-1
it _ I-1
is _ I-1
. _ I-1

This _ B-1
product _ I-1
is _ I-1
extremely _ I-1
effective _ I-1
because _ I-1
it _ I-1
chemically _ I-1
dissolves _ I-1
pollutants _ I-1
in _ I-1
the _ I-1
pores _ I-1
so _ I-1
there _ I-1
won't _ I-1
be _ I-1
a _ I-1
need _ I-1
for _ I-1
any _ I-1
other _ I-1
acne _ I-1
marketed _ I-1
facial _ I-1
soaps _ I-1
. _ I-1
Balances _ I-1
pH _ I-1
levels _ I-1
and _ I-1
solves _ I-1
oily _ I-1
skin _ I-1
. _ I-1
